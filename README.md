The essence of the game's implementation is the fast switching of multiple pictures, similar to animation, to achieve a dynamic effect. For example, the firing of a bullet is actually a photo of a bullet pasted to the interface several times according to the position stored in the list. There is also the movement of the plane, which is first collected to change the coordinates and then pasted the next time the page is covered.
